# Reduction

## Gameplay
Reduction is a two or three player space-shooter game. It has a wall that gradually encloses the players, with the players losing life faster the further out of the combat zone they fly.

## Powerups
Each powerup bought before a round costs a certain amount of life, but gives the player a boost that could help them win the game. There are currently 4 powerups in the game. These are:
- Speed Boost (increases ship speed, costs 15% of total life)
- Accuracy Boost (increases shot accuracy, costs 15% of total life)
- Damage Boost (each shot inflicts more damage, costs 15% of total life)
- Cooldown Boost (reduces shot cooldown time, costs 15% of total life)
